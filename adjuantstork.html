                <h2>Intrpduction</h2>
                <p>The greater adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius) is a member of the stork family, Ciconiidae. Its genus includes the lesser adjutant of Asia and the marabou stork of Africa. Once found widely across southern Asia and mainland southeast Asia, the greater adjutant is now restricted to a much smaller range with only three breeding populations; two in India, with the largest colony in surat and a smaller one around Bhagalpur; and another breeding population in Cambodia. They disperse widely after the breeding season. This large stork has a massive wedge-shaped bill, a bare head and a distinctive neck pouch. During the day, it soars in thermals along with vultures with whom it shares the habit of scavenging. </p>

                <h2>Taxonomy
                </h2>
                <p>The greater adjutant was described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham as the "giant crane" in his book A General Synopsis of Birds. Lathan based his own description on that given by Edward Ives in his A Voyage from England to India that was published in 1773. Ives had shot a specimen near Calcutta. In his account Latham also mentioned that he had learned from the traveller Henry Smeathman that a similar species was found in Africa.[4][5] When in 1789 the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin revised and expanded Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae, he included the greater adjutant, coined the binomial name Ardea dubia and cited Latham's work.</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The greater adjutant is a huge bird, standing tall at 145–150 cm (4 ft 9 in – 4 ft 11 in). The average length is 136 cm (4 ft 6 in) and average wingspan is 250 cm (8 ft 2 in), it may rival its cousin the marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus) as the largest winged extant stork.[16] While no weights have been published for wild birds, the greater adjutant is among the largest of living storks, with published measurements overlapping with those of the jabiru (Jabiru mycteria), saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis) and marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus). Juvenile greater adjutant storks in captivity weighed from 8 to 11 kg (18 to 24 lb).[17] A greater adjutant after recuperating in captivity from after injury during nest collapse was found to weigh 4.71 kg (10.4 lb) as a nestling and to weigh 8 kg (18 lb) after reaching maturity and ready for re-release.</p>

                <h2>Distribution</h2>
                <p>This species was once a widespread winter visitor in the riverine plains of northern India. However, their breeding areas were largely unknown for a long time until a very large nesting colony was finally discovered in 1877 at Shwaygheen on the Sittaung River, Pegu, Burma. It was believed that the Indian birds bred there.[27][28] This breeding colony, which also included spot-billed pelicans (Pelecanus philippensis), declined in size and entirely vanished by the 1930s.[29] Subsequently, a nest site in Kaziranga was the only known breeding area until new sites were discovered in Assam, the Tonle Sap lake and in the Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary. In 1989, the breeding population in Assam was estimated at 115 birds,[29][30][31][32] and between 1994 and 1996 the population in the Brahmaputra valley was considered to be about 600.[33][34] A small colony with about 35 nests was discovered near Bhagalpur in 2006. The number increased to 75 nests in 2014.</p>

                <h2>Behaviour and ecology</h2>
                <p>The greater adjutant is usually seen singly or in small groups as it stalks about in shallow lakes or drying lake beds and garbage dumps. It is often found in the company of kites and vultures and will sometimes sit hunched still for long durations.[14] They may also hold their wings outstretched, presumably to control their temperature.[44] They soar on thermals using their large outstretched wings.</p>

                <h2>Breeding</h2>
                <p>The greater adjutant breeds during winter in colonies that may include other large waterbirds such as the spot-billed pelican. The nest is a large platform of twigs placed at the end of a near-horizontal branch of a tall tree.[27] Nests are rarely placed in forks near the center of a tree, allowing the birds to fly easily from and to the nests. In the Nagaon nesting colony in Assam, tall Alstonia scholaris and Anthocephalus cadamba were favourite nest trees.[45] The beginning of the breeding season is marked by several birds congregating and trying to occupy a tree. While crowding at these sites, male birds mark out their nesting territories, chasing away others and frequently pointing their bill upwards while clattering them. </p>
