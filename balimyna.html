                <h2>Intrpduction</h2>
                <p>The Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi), also known as Rothschild's mynah, Bali starling, or Bali mynah, locally known as jalak Bali, is a medium-sized (up to 25 cm (9.8 in) long), stocky myna, almost wholly white with a long, drooping crest, and black tips on the wings and tail. The bird has blue bare skin around the eyes, greyish legs and a yellow bill. Both sexes are similar. It is critically endangered and in 2020, fewer than 50 adults were assumed to exist in the wild..</p>

                <h2>Taxonomy and systematics
                </h2>
                <p>The Bali myna was formally described in 1912 by the German ornithologist Erwin Stresemann based on a female specimen collected on the island of Bali in Indonesia. He introduced a new genus Leucopsar and coined the binomial name Leucopsar rothschildi.[4] The genus name combines the Ancient greek leukos meaning "white" with psar meaning "starling".[5] The specific epithet was chosen to honour Walter Rothschild who had allowed Stresemann to examine birds at his museum in Tring, Hertfordshire, England.[4] The Bali myna remains the only species placed in the genus Leucopsar. It appears to be most closely related to Sturnia and the brahminy starling which was initially placed in Sturnus then later moved by a study in 2008 to Sturnia,[6] as Sturnus as delimited was highly paraphyletic.</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The Bali myna is a medium-large starling around 25 centimetres (9.8 in) in length. It is almost wholly white with a long, drooping crest, black wing-tips and tail tip. It has a yellow bill with blue bare skin around the eyes and legs. The sexes are similar in appearance but the male has a longer crest than the female.[8] The black-winged myna (Acridotheres melanopterus), a similar species, has a shorter crest and a much larger area of black on wings and tail, plus a yellow eye-ring (without feathers) and legs.</p>

                <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
                <p>The Bali myna is restricted to the northwest Bali (and its offshore islands) in Indonesia,[1][9] where it is the island's only endemic vertebrate species. In 1991, the bird was designated the faunal emblem of Bali. Featured on the Indonesian 200 rupiah coin, its local name is jalak Bali </p>

                <h2>Behaviour and ecology</h2>
                <p>In its natural habitat it is inconspicuous, using tree tops for cover and–unlike other starlings–usually coming to the ground only to drink or to find nesting materials; this would seem to be an adaptation to its noticeability to predators when out in the open. The Bali mynah often gathers in groups when it is young to better locate food and watch out for predators.[10] The vocalizations are a variety of sharp chattering calls and an emphatic tweet.[1]

                    The Bali myna's diet includes fruit, seeds, worms and insects.</p>

                <h2>Nusa Penida island</h2>
                <p>A population of Bali mynas now exists on the island of Nusa Penida and its sister islands of Nusa Ceningan, Nusa Lembongan, which are 14 km off the south east coast of Bali. The islands have been transformed into an unofficial bird sanctuary by Friends of National Parks Foundation (FNPF), an Indonesian NGO based in Bali.[12] This was achieved by FNPF working for many years with the 40+ villages on the islands and persuading every village to pass a traditional Balinese village regulation to protect birds, and effectively removing the threat of poachers. Since then, FNPF has rehabilitated and released several endangered birds onto the island of Nusa Penida, including many Bali mynas supplied from multiple breeders.</p>
