                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                
                <p><li class="list">The Black-footed ferret , also known as the American polecat or prairie dog hunter, is a species of mustelid native to central North America.</li></p>

                   <p><li class="list"> The Black-footed ferret is roughly the size of a mink and is similar in appearance to the European polecat and the Asian steppe polecat.</li></p><p><li class="list"> It is largely nocturnal and solitary, except when breeding or raising litters. Up to 90% of its diet is composed of prairie dogs.</li></p>

                <p><li class="list"> its close relative, the Asian steppe polecat , the black-footed ferret represents a more progressive form than the European polecat in the direction of carnivory.</li></p> <p><li class="list">Black-footed ferret's most likely ancestor was Mustela stromeri , which originated in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene. </li></p> <p><li class="list"> that the steppe polecat and black-footed ferret diverged from M. stromeri between 500,000 and 2,000,000 years ago, perhaps in Beringia.</li></p><p><li class="list"> The species appeared in the Great Basin and the Rockies by 750,000 years ago. The oldest recorded fossil find originates from Cathedral Cave, White Pine County, Nevada, and dates back 750,000 to 950,000 years ago.</li></p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
               
                <p><li class="list"> Black-footed ferret has a long, slender body with black outlines on its paws, ears, parts of its face and its tail.</li></p> <p><li class="list"> is arched and broad, and the muzzle is short. It has few whiskers, and its ears are triangular, short, erect and broad at the base. The neck is long and the legs short and stout. The toes are armed with sharp, very slightly arched claws.</li></p><p><li class="list"> The feet on both surfaces are covered in hair, even to the soles, thus concealing</li></p><p><li class="list"> the claws. It combines several physical features common in both members of the subgenus Gale (least and short-tailed weasels) and Putorius (European and steppe polecats).</li> </p>

                <h2>Behaviour</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> Black-footed ferret is solitary, except when breeding or raising litters. It is nocturnal and primarily hunts for sleeping prairie dogs in their burrows.</li></p><p><li class="list"> It is most active above ground from dusk to midnight and 4 am to mid-morning. Aboveground activity is greatest during late summer and early autumn when juveniles become independent.</li></p> <p><li class="list"> Climate generally does not limit black-footed ferret activity, but it may remain inactive inside burrows for up to 6 days at a time during winter.</li></p>

                  <p><li class="list">  Female black-footed ferrets have smaller home ranges than males. Home ranges of males may sometimes include the home ranges of several females.Adult females usually occupy the same territory every year.</li></p>

                <h2>Reproduction and development</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> reproductive physiology of the black-footed ferret is similar to that of the European polecat and the steppe polecat. It is probably polygynous, based on data collected from home range sizes, skewed sex ratios, and sexual dimorphism.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Mating occurs in February and March.When a male and female in estrus encounter each other, the male sniffs the genital region of the female, but does not mount her until after a few hours have elapsed, which is contrast to the more violent behavior displayed by the male European polecat.</li></p><p><li class="list"> During copulation, the male grasps the female by the nape of the neck, with the copulatory tie lasting from 1.5 to 3.0 hours. Unlike other mustelids, the black-footed ferret is a habitat specialist with low reproductive rates.In captivity, gestation of black-footed ferrets lasts 42â€“45 days.</li></p>

                <h2>Diet</h2>
                <p> <li class="list"> Up to 90% of the black-footed ferret's diet is composed of prairie dogs. The remaining 10% of their diet is composed of small rodents, and lagomorphs.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Their diet varies depending on geographic location. In western Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana, black-footed ferrets are historically associated with white-tailed prairie dogs and were forced to find alternative prey when white-tailed prairie dogs entered their four-month hibernation cycle.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Wyoming, alternative prey items consumed during white-tailed prairie dog hibernation included voles (Microtus spp.) and mice (Peromyscus and Mus spp.) found near streams.</li></p>

                <p><li class="list"> The historical range of the black-footed ferret was closely correlated with, but not restricted to, the range of prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.). Its range extended from southern Alberta and southern Saskatchewan south to Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.</li></p><p><li class="list"> As of 2007, the only known wild black-footed ferret population was located on approximately 6,000 acres (2,400 hectares) in the western Big Horn Basin near Meeteetse, Wyoming.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Since 1990, black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced to the following sites: Shirley Basin, Wyoming; UL Bend National Wildlife Refuge and Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, Montana.</li></p>
