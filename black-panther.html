                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>A black panther is the melanistic colour variant of the leopard (Panthera pardus) and the jaguar (Panthera onca). Black panthers of both species have excess black pigments, but their typical rosettes are also present. They have been documented mostly in tropical forests, with black leopards in Africa and Asia, and black jaguars in South America. Melanism is caused by a recessive allele in the leopard, and by a dominant allele in the jaguar.</p>

                <h2>Panther as leopard</h2>
                <p>In 1788, Jean-Claude Delamétherie described a black leopard that was kept in the Tower of London and had been brought from Bengal.[1] In 1794, Friedrich Albrecht Anton Meyer proposed the scientific name Felis fusca for this cat, the Indian leopard (P. p. fusca).[2][3] In 1809, Georges Cuvier described a black leopard kept in the Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes that had been brought from Java. Cuvier proposed the name Felis melas, the Javan leopard (P. p. melas).[3][4] By the late 19th century, the occurrence of black and spotted leopard cubs in the same litter had been repeatedly recorded in India. Black leopards were thought to be more common in Travancore and in the hills of southern India than in other parts of the country.[5] Black leopards were also frequently encountered in southern Myanmar.[6] By 1929, the Natural History Museum, London had skins of black leopards collected in South Africa, Nepal, Assam and Kanara in India.</p>

                <h2>Panther as Jaguar</h2>
                <p>In 1801, Félix de Azara described a black jaguar observed by local people near the Paraná River in Paraguay.[28] In 2004, a female black jaguar was recorded in Mexico's Sierra Madre Occidental.[29] In 2009, a black jaguar was photographed by a camera trap for the first time in Costa Rica's Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve.[30] In Barbilla National Park, black jaguars were recorded in 2013.[31] In the mountains of the Cordillera de Talamanca, 104 records of jaguars were obtained between 2010 and 2019; 26 of them showed melanistic jaguars.[32] In eastern Panama, black jaguars were repeatedly photographed in the Mamoní River Valley between 2016 and 2018, mostly in primary forest.[33] Five black jaguars have been monitored in the Várzea forest of Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve in the Brazilian State of Amazonas between 2003 and 2018.[34] Black jaguars were also recorded in the Brazilian Pará state. </p>

                <h2>White pantherr</h2>
                <p>A white panther is a white specimen of any of several species of larger cat. "Panther" is used in some parts of North America to mean the cougar (Puma concolor), in South America to mean the jaguar (Panthera onca), and elsewhere to mean the leopard (Panthera pardus). A white panther may then be a white cougar, a white jaguar, or a white leopard. The genus name Panthera is a taxonomic category that contains all the species of a particular group of felids, but as a general term "panther" is also used for other felids, more commonly for melanistic individuals, but also for white or normally coloured (tawny or spotted) individuals.</p>
