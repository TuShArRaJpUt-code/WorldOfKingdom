                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal and a baleen whale. Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 m (98 ft) and weighing up to 199 t (196 long tons; 219 short tons), it is the largest animal known ever to have existed.[a] The blue whale's long and slender body can be of various shades of greyish-blue on its upper surface and somewhat lighter underneath. Four subspecies are recognized: B. m. musculus in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia in the Southern Ocean, B. m. brevicauda (the pygmy blue whale) in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, and B. m. indica in the Northern Indian Ocean. There is a population in the waters off Chile that may constitute a fifth subspecies.</p>

                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <p>Blue whales are rorquals in the family Balaenopteridae. A 2018 analysis estimates that the Balaenopteridae family diverged from other families in between 10.48 and 4.98 million years ago during the late Miocene.[13] The earliest discovered anatomically modern blue whale is a partial skull fossil from southern Italy identified as B. cf. musculus, dating to the Early Pleistocene, roughly 1.5–1.25 million years ago.[14] The Australian pygmy blue whale diverged during the Last Glacial Maximum. Their more recent divergence has resulted in the subspecies having a relatively low genetic diversity,[15] and New Zealand blue whales have an even lower genetic diversity.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The blue whale is a slender-bodied cetacean with a broad U-shaped head; thin, elongated flippers; a small 33 centimeters (13 in) sickle-shaped dorsal fin located close to the tail, and a large tail stock at the root of the wide and thin flukes. The upper jaw is lined with 70–395 black baleen plates. The throat region has 60–88 grooves which allows the skin to expand during feeding.[6][7][32][33][34] It has two blowholes that can squirt 9.1–12.2 meters (30–40 ft) up in the air.[6][32][33] The skin has a mottled grayish-blue coloration, appearing blue underwater.[7][32][33] The mottling patterns near the dorsal fin vary between individuals.[35][36][37] The underbelly has lighter pigmentation and can appear yellowish due to diatoms in the water,[7][32][33] which historically earned them the nickname "sulphur bottom".[12][38] The male blue whale has the largest penis in the animal kingdom, at around 3 m (9.8 ft) long and 12 in (30 cm) wide.</p>

                <h2>Behaviour and ecology</h2>
                <p>The blue whale is usually solitary, but can be found in pairs. When productivity is high enough, blue whales can be seen in gatherings of more than 50 individuals.[32] Populations may go on long migrations, traveling to their summer feeding grounds towards the poles and then heading to their winter breeding grounds in more equatorial waters.[62] The animals appear to use memory to locate the best feeding areas.[63] There is evidence of alternative strategies, such as year-round residency, and partial (where only some individuals migrate) or age/sex-based migration. Some whales have been recorded feeding in breeding grounds.[64] The traveling speed for blue whales ranges 5–30 kilometers per hour (3.1–18.6 mph).[32] Their massive size limits their ability to breach.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Diet and feeding</h2>
                <p>The blue whale's diet consists almost exclusively of krill.[32] Blue whales capture krill through lunge feeding; they swim towards them at high speeds as they open their mouths up to 80°.[32][66] They may engulf 220 metric tons (220 long tons; 240 short tons) of water at one time.[70] They squeeze the water out through their baleen plates with pressure from the throat pouch and tongue, and swallow the remaining krill.[32][66] Blue whales have been recorded making 180° rolls during lunge-feeding, possibly allowing them to search the prey field and find the densest patches.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Reproduction and birth</h2>
                <p>Blue whales generally reach sexual maturity at 8–10 years. In the Northern Hemisphere, the length at which they reach maturity is 21–23 meters (69–75 ft) for females and 20–21 meters (66–69 ft) for males. In the Southern Hemisphere, the length of maturity is 23–24 meters (75–79 ft) and 22 meters (72 ft) for females and males respectively.[81] Male pygmy blue whales average 18.7 meters (61.4 ft) at sexual maturity.[82][83] Female pygmy blue whales are 21.0–21.7 meters (68.9–71.2 ft) in length[49] and roughly 10 years old at the age of sexual maturity.[49][50][84] Little is known about mating behavior, or breeding and birthing areas.[42][81] Blue whales appear to be polygynous, with males competing for females.[81][85] A male blue whale typically trails a female and will fight off potential rivals.[86] The species mates from fall to winter.</p>

                <h2>Conservation</h2>
                <p>The global blue whale population is estimated to be 5,000–15,000 mature individuals and 10,000–25,000 total as of 2018. By comparison, there were at least 140,000 mature whales in 1926. There are an estimated total of 1,000–3,000 whales in the North Atlantic, 3,000–5,000 in the North Pacific, and 5,000–8,000 in the Antarctic. There are possibly 1,000–3,000 whales in the eastern South Pacific while the pygmy blue whale may number 2,000–5,000 individuals.[1] Blue whales have been protected in areas of the Southern Hemisphere since 1939. In 1955, they were given complete protection in the North Atlantic under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling; this protection was extended to the Antarctic in 1965 and the North Pacific in 1966.[116][117] The protected status of North Atlantic blue whales was not recognized by Iceland until 1960.[118] In the United States, the species is protected under the Endangered Species Act..</p>
