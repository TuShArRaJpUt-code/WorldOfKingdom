                <h2>Intrpduction</h2>
                <p>TThe Siberian crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus), also known as the Siberian white crane or the snow crane, is a bird of the family Gruidae, the cranes. They are distinctive among the cranes: adults are nearly all snowy white, except for their black primary feathers that are visible in flight, and with two breeding populations in the Arctic tundra of western and eastern Russia. The eastern populations migrate during winter to China, while the western population winters in Iran and (formerly) in Bharatpur, India.</p>

                <h2>Taxonomy and systematics
                </h2>
                <p>The Siberian crane was formally described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1773 and given the binomial name Grus leucogeranus.[3][4] The specific epithet is derived from the classical Greek words leukos for "white" and geranos for a "crane".[5] Ustad Mansur, a 17th-century court artist and singer of Jahangir, had illustrated a Siberian crane about 100 years earlier.[6] The genus Megalornis was used for the cranes by George Robert Gray and this species was included in it, while Richard Bowdler Sharpe suggested a separation from Grus and used the genus Sarcogeranus.[7][8][9] The Siberian crane lacks the complex tracheal coils found in most other cranes but shares this feature with the wattled crane.</p>

        <div class="content" data-animation="slideInFromRight">
            <img class="third" src="images/crane3.jpg" alt="Image 4">
            <div class="text">
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Adults of both sexes have a pure white plumage except for the black primaries, alula and primary coverts. The fore-crown, face and side of head is bare and brick red, the bill is dark and the legs are pinkish. The iris is yellowish. Juveniles are feathered on the face and the plumage is dingy brown. There are no elongated tertial feathers as in some other crane species.[15] During breeding season, both the male and female cranes are often seen with mud streaking their feathers; they may intentionally smear mud on their feathers, which has been hypothesized to aid camouflage on the nest. The call is very different from the trumpeting of most cranes and is a goose-like high pitched whistling toyoya.</p>

        <div class="content" data-animation="slideInFromLeft">
            <img class="fourth" src="images/crane4.jpg" alt="image-5">
            <div class="text">
                <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
                <p>The breeding area of the Siberian crane formerly extended between the Urals and Ob river south to the Ishim and Tobol rivers and east to the Kolyma region. The populations declined with changes in landuse, the draining of wetlands for agricultural expansion and hunting on their migration routes. The breeding areas in modern times are restricted to two widely disjunct regions. The western area in the river basins of the Ob, Konda and Sossva and to the east a much larger population in Yakutia between the Yana and the Alazeya rivers.[17] Like most cranes, the Siberian crane inhabits shallow marshlands and wetlands and will often forage in deeper water than other cranes.  </p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Behaviour and ecology</h2>
                <p>In its natural habitat it is inconspicuous, using tree tops for cover and–unlike other starlings–usually coming to the ground only to drink or to find nesting materials; this would seem to be an adaptation to its noticeability to predators when out in the open. The Bali mynah often gathers in groups when it is young to better locate food and watch out for predators.[10] The vocalizations are a variety of sharp chattering calls and an emphatic tweet.[1]

                    The Bali myna's diet includes fruit, seeds, worms and insects.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Feeding</h2>
                <p>These cranes are omnivorous with a tendency to plant matter. In the summer grounds they feed on a range of plants including the roots of hellebore (Veratrum misae), seeds of Empetrum nigrum as well as small rodents like lemmings and voles, earthworms, and fish. They were earlier thought to be predominantly fish eating on the basis of the serrated edge of their bill, but later studies suggest that they take animal prey mainly when the vegetation is covered by snow. They also swallow pebbles and grit to aid in crushing food in their crop.[17] In their wintering grounds in China, they have been noted to feed to a large extent on the submerged leaves of Vallisneria spiralis.</p>
