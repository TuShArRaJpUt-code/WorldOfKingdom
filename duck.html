                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The mallard is considered to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Unlike many waterfowl, mallards are considered an invasive species in some regions. It is a very adaptable species, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The non-migratory mallard interbreeds with indigenous wild ducks of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. This species is the main ancestor of most breeds of domestic duck, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool has been genetically polluted by the domestic and feral mallard populations.</p>

                <h2>Taxonomy and evolutionary history
                </h2>
                <p>The name mallard originally referred to any wild drake, and it is sometimes still used this way.[8] It was derived from the Old French malart or mallart for "wild drake" although its true derivation is unclear.[9] It may be related to, or at least influenced by, an Old High German masculine proper name Madelhart, clues lying in the alternative English forms "maudelard" and "mawdelard".[10] Masle (male) has also been proposed as an influence.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The breeding male mallard is unmistakable, with a glossy bottle-green head and a white collar that demarcates the head from the purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly.[28] The rear of the male is black, with white-bordered dark tail feathers.[25]: 506  The bill of the male is a yellowish-orange tipped with black, with that of the female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown.[29] The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to very dark brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe.</p>

                <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
                <p>
                    The mallard is widely distributed across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres; in North America its range extends from southern and central Alaska to Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands,[54] across the Palearctic,[55] from Iceland[56] and southern Greenland[54] and parts of Morocco (North Africa)[56] in the west, Scandinavia[56] and Britain[56] to the north, and to Siberia,[57] Japan,[58] and South Korea.[58] Also in the east, it ranges to south-eastern and south-western Australia[59] and New Zealand[60] in the Southern hemisphere.[25]: 505 [1] It is strongly migratory in the northern parts of its breeding range, and winters farther south.

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Feeding</h2>
                <p>The mallard is omnivorous and very flexible in its choice of food.[72] Its diet may vary based on several factors, including the stage of the breeding cycle, short-term variations in available food, nutrient availability, and interspecific and intraspecific competition.[73] The majority of the mallard's diet seems to be made up of gastropods,[74] insects (including beetles, flies, lepidopterans, dragonflies, and caddisflies),[75] crustaceans,[76] other arthropods,[77] worms,[74] feces of other birds,[78] many varieties of seeds and plant matter,[74] and roots and tubers.[76] During the breeding season, male birds were recorded to have eaten 37.6% animal matter and 62.4% plant matter, most notably the grass Echinochloa crus-galli, and nonlaying females ate 37.0% animal matter and 63.0% plant matter, while laying females ate 71.9% animal matter and only 28.1% plant matter.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Breeding</h2>
                <p>Mallards usually form pairs (in October and November in the Northern Hemisphere) until the female lays eggs at the start of the nesting season, which is around the beginning of spring.[85] At this time she is left by the male who joins up with other males to await the moulting period, which begins in June (in the Northern Hemisphere).[86][87] During the brief time before this, however, the males are still sexually potent and some of them either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches (for female mallards that have lost or abandoned their previous clutch)[88] or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species and whether or not they have a brood of ducklings.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Predators and threats</h2>
                <p>In addition to human hunting, mallards of all ages (but especially young ones) and in all locations must contend with a wide diversity of predators including raptors and owls, mustelids, corvids, snakes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, turtles, large fish, felids, and canids, the last two including domestic cats and dogs.[107] The most prolific natural predators of adult mallards are red foxes (Vulpes vulpes; which most often pick off brooding females) and the faster or larger birds of prey, (e.g. peregrine falcons, Aquila or Haliaeetus eagles).[108] In North America, adult mallards face no fewer than 15 species of birds of prey, from northern harriers (Circus hudsonius) and short-eared owls (Asio flammeus) (both smaller than a mallard) to huge bald (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), and about a dozen species of mammalian predators, not counting several more avian and mammalian predators who threaten eggs and nestlings.</p>
