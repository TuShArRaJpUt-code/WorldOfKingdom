    <h1>THE ELECTRIC EEL</h1>

                <h2>Intrpduction</h2>
                <p>The electric eels are a genus, Electrophorus, of neotropical freshwater fish from South America in the family Gymnotidae. They are known for their ability to stun their prey by generating electricity, delivering shocks at up to 860 volts. Their electrical capabilities were first studied in 1775, contributing to the invention in 1800 of the electric battery.

                    Despite their name, electric eels are not closely related to the true eels (Anguilliformes) but are members of the electroreceptive knifefish order, Gymnotiformes. This order is more closely related to catfish. In 2019, electric eels were split into three species: for more than two centuries before that, the genus was believed to be monotypic, containing only Electrophorus electricus.

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <p>When the species now defined as Electrophorus electricus was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1766, based on early field research by Europeans in South America and specimens sent back to Europe for study,[3][4][5] he used the name Gymnotus electricus, placing it in the same genus as Gymnotus carapo (the banded knifefish).[6][7][8] He noted that the fish is from the rivers of Surinam, that it causes painful shocks, and that it had small pits around the head.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Species</h2>
                <p>Electrophorus electricus (Linnaeus, 1766) This, the type species, has a U-shaped head, with a flattened skull and cleithrum.[13]
                    Electrophorus voltai de Santana, Wosiacki, Crampton, Mark H. Sabaj, Dillman, Castro e Castro, Bastos and Vari, 2019 This species is the strongest bioelectricity generator in nature, capable of generating 860 V. Like E. electricus, this species has a flattened skull and cleithrum but the head is more egg-shaped.[13]
                    Electrophorus varii de Santana, Wosiacki, Crampton, Mark H. Sabaj, Dillman, Mendes-JÃºnior and Castro e Castro, 2019 Compared to the other two species, this one has a thicker skull and cleithrum but the head shape is more variable.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Ecology</h2>
                <p>The three species have largely non-overlapping distributions in the northern part of South America. E. electricus is northern, confined to the Guiana Shield, while E. voltai is southern, ranging from the Brazilian shield northwards; both species live in upland waters. E. varii is central, largely in the lowlands.[13] The lowland region of E. varii is a variable environment, with habitats ranging from streams through grassland and ravines to ponds, and large changes in water level between the wet and dry seasons.[21] All live on muddy river bottoms and sometimes swamps, favouring areas in deep shade. They can tolerate water low in oxygen as they swim to the surface to breathe air.</p>

                <h2>Biology</h2>
                <p>Electric eels have long, stout bodies, being somewhat cylindrical at the front but more flattened towards the tail end. E. electricus can reach 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in length, and 20 kg (44 lb) in weight. The mouth is at the front of the snout, and opens upwards. They have smooth, thick, brown-to-black skin with a yellow or red underbelly and no scales.[13][28][29] The pectoral fins each possess eight tiny radial bones at the tip.[28] They have over 100 precaudal vertebrae (excluding the tail), whereas other gymnotids have up to 51 of these; there can be as many as 300 vertebrae in total. </p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Electrophysiology</h2>
                <p>Electric eels can locate their prey using electroreceptors derived from the lateral line organ in the head. The lateral line itself is mechanosensory, enabling them to sense water movements created by animals nearby. The lateral line canals are beneath the skin, but their position is visible as lines of pits on the head.[38] Electric eels use their high frequency-sensitive tuberous receptors, distributed in patches over the body, for hunting other knifefish.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Life cycle</h2>
                <p>Electric eels reproduce during the dry season, from September to December. During this time, male-female pairs are seen in small pools left behind after water levels drop. The male makes a nest using his saliva and the female deposits around 1,200 eggs for fertilisation. Spawn hatch seven days later and mothers keep depositing eggs periodically throughout the breeding season, making them fractional spawners.[53] When they reach 15 mm (0.59 in), the hatched larvae consume any leftover eggs, and after they reach 9 cm (3.5 in) they begin to eat other foods.[54] Electric eels are sexually dimorphic, males becoming reproductively active at 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) in length and growing larger than females; females start to reproduce at a body length of around 70 cm (2 ft 4 in). </p>
