                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>The word elephant is derived from the Latin word elephas (genitive elephantis) 'elephant', which is the Latinised form of the ancient Greek ἐλέφας (elephas) (genitive ἐλέφαντος (elephantos[1])), probably from a non-Indo-European language, likely Phoenician.[2] It is attested in Mycenaean Greek as e-re-pa (genitive e-re-pa-to) in Linear B syllabic script.[3][4] As in Mycenaean Greek, Homer used the Greek word to mean ivory, but after the time of Herodotus, it also referred to the animal.[1] The word elephant appears in Middle English as olyfaunt (c. 1300) and was borrowed from Old French oliphant (12th century).[.</p>

                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <p>Over 180 extinct members of order Proboscidea have been described.[14] The earliest proboscideans, the African Eritherium and Phosphatherium are known from the late Paleocene.[15] The Eocene included Numidotherium, Moeritherium, and Barytherium from Africa. These animals were relatively small and, some, like Moeritherium and Barytherium were probably amphibious.[16][17] Later on, genera such as Phiomia and Palaeomastodon arose; the latter likely inhabited more forested areas. Proboscidean diversification changed little during the Oligocene.[16] One notable species of this epoch was Eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of the Horn of Africa, which may have been an ancestor to several later species.[</p>

                <h2>Anatomy</h2>
                <p>Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. Some species of the extinct elephant genus Palaeoloxodon considerably exceeded modern elephants in size making them among the largest land mammals ever.[32] The skeleton is made up of 326–351 bones.[36] The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.[37] The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. By contrast, the lower jaw is dense. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head.[36] The skull is built to withstand great stress, particularly when fighting or using the tusks. The brain is surrounded by arches in the skull, which serve as protection.[38] Because of the size of the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support.[ </p>

                <h2>Ears and eyes</h2>
                <p>Elephant ear flaps, or pinnae, are 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) thick in the middle with a thinner tip and supported by a thicker base. They contain numerous blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood flows into the capillaries, releasing excess heat into the environment. This effect is increased by flapping the ears back and forth. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates and have the largest ear flaps.[36][40] The ossicles are adapted for hearing low frequencies, being most sensitive at 1 kHz.[</p>

                <h2>Behaviour and ecology</h2>
                <p>Elephants are herbivorous and will eat leaves, twigs, fruit, bark, grass, and roots. African elephants mostly browse, while Asian elephants mainly graze.[34] They can eat as much as 300 kg (660 lb) of food and drink 40 L (11 US gal) of water in a day. Elephants tend to stay near water sources.[34][86] They have morning, afternoon, and nighttime feeding sessions. At midday, elephants rest under trees and may doze off while standing. Sleeping occurs at night while the animal is lying down.[86] Elephants average 3–4 hours of sleep per day.[87] Both males and family groups typically move no more than 20 km (12 mi) a day, but distances as far as 180 km (112 mi) have been recorded in the Etosha region of Namibia.[88] Elephants go on seasonal migrations in response to changes in environmental conditions.</p>

                <h2>Social organisation</h2>
                <p>Elephants are generally gregarious animals. African bush elephants in particular have a complex, stratified social structure.[99] Female elephants spend their entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups.[100] They are led by the matriarch, who is often the eldest female.[101] She remains leader of the group until death[94] or if she no longer has the energy for the role;[102] a study on zoo elephants found that the death of the matriarch led to greater stress in the surviving elephants.[103] When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place instead of her sister (if present).[94] One study found that younger matriarchs take potential threats less seriously.[104] Large family groups may split if they cannot be supported by local resources.</p>
