                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hyenas or hyaenas (/haɪˈiːnəz/ hi-EE-nəz; from Ancient Greek ὕαινα, hýaina)[1] are feliform carnivoran mammals belonging to the family Hyaenidae (/haɪˈɛnɪdiː/). With just four extant species (each in its own genus), it is the fifth-smallest family in the order Carnivora and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia.[2] Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems.[3]

                    Although phylogenetically closer to felines and viverrids, hyenas are behaviourally and morphologically similar to canids in several elements due to convergent evolution: both hyenas and canines are non-arboreal, cursorial hunters that catch prey with their teeth rather than claws. </p>

                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <p>Hyenas originated in the jungles of Miocene Eurasia 22 million years ago, when most early feliform species were still largely arboreal. The first ancestral hyenas were likely similar to the modern African civet; one of the earliest hyena species described, Plioviverrops, was a lithe, civet-like animal that inhabited Eurasia 20–22 million years ago, and is identifiable as a hyaenid by the structure of the middle ear and dentition. The lineage of Plioviverrops prospered, and gave rise to descendants with longer legs and more pointed jaws, a direction similar to that taken by canids in North America.[7] Hyenas then diversified into two distinct types: lightly built dog-like hyenas and robust bone-crushing hyenas. Although the dog-like hyenas thrived 15 million years ago (with one taxon having colonised North America), they became extinct after a change in climate, along with the arrival of canids into Eurasia. Of the dog-like hyena lineage, only the insectivorous aardwolf survived, while the bone-crushing hyenas (including the extant spotted, brown and striped hyenas) became the undisputed top scavengers of Eurasia and Africa</p>

                <h2>Characteristics</h2>
                <p>Hyenas have relatively short torsos and are fairly massive and wolf-like in build, but have lower hind quarters, high withers and their backs slope noticeably downward towards their rumps. The forelegs are high, while the hind legs are very short and their necks are thick and short. Their skulls superficially resemble those of large canids, but are much larger and heavier, with shorter facial portions. Hyenas are digitigrade, with the fore and hind paws having four digits each and sporting bulging pawpads.[28] Like canids, hyenas have short, blunt, non-retractable claws.[29] Their pelage is sparse and coarse with poorly developed or absent underfur. Most species have a rich mane of long hair running from the withers or from the head.[28] With the exception of the spotted hyena, hyaenids have striped coats, which they likely inherited from their viverrid ancestors.[7] Their ears are large and have simple basal ridges and no marginal bursa.[29] Their vertebral column, including the cervical region are of limited mobility. Hyenas have no baculum.[30] Hyenas have one more pair of ribs than canids do, and their tongues are rough like those of felids and viverrids.</p>

                <h2>Behavior</h2>
                <p>Hyenas groom themselves often like felids and viverrids, and their way of licking their genitals is very cat-like (sitting on the lower back, legs spread with one leg pointing vertically upward). They defecate in the same manner as other Carnivora, though they never raise their legs as canids do when urinating, as urination serves no territorial function for them. Instead, hyenas mark their territories using their anal glands, a trait found also in viverrids and mustelids, but not canids and felids.[42] When attacked by lions or dogs, striped[43] and brown hyenas[44] will feign death, though the spotted hyena will defend itself ferociously.[36] The spotted hyena is very vocal, producing a number of different sounds consisting of whoops, grunts, groans, lows, giggles, yells, growls, laughs and whines.[45] The striped hyena is comparatively silent, its vocalizations being limited to a chattering laugh and howling.</p>

                <h2>Folklore, mythology and literature</h2>
                <p>Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It is often difficult to know whether spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In West African tales, spotted hyenas are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire.[58] In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth, while West African folklore generally shows the hyena as symbolizing immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits. In Tanzania, there is a belief that witches use spotted hyenas as mounts.</p>

                <h2>Attacks on humans</h2>
                <p>In ordinary circumstances, striped hyenas are extremely timid around humans, though they may show bold behaviors towards people at night.[65] On rare occasions, striped hyenas have preyed on humans.

                    Among hyenas, only the spotted and striped hyenas have been known to become man-eaters. Hyenas are known to have preyed on humans in prehistory: human hair has been found in fossilized hyena dung dating back 195,000 to 257,000 years.[66] Some paleontologists believe that competition and predation by cave hyenas (Crocuta crocuta spelaea) in Siberia was a significant factor in delaying human colonization of Alaska. Hyenas may have occasionally stolen human kills, or entered campsites to drag off the young and weak, much like modern spotted hyenas in Africa.</p>

                <h2>Hyenas as food and medicine</h2>
                <p>Hyenas are used for food and medicinal purposes in Somalia.[78] They are considered halal in Islam.[79] This practice dates back to the times of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, who believed that different parts of the hyena's body were effective means to ward off evil and to ensure love and fertility.</p>
