                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The imperial amazon (Amazona imperialis) or Dominican amazon, also known as the sisserou or sisserou parrot, is a parrot found only on the Caribbean island of Dominica.[3] It has been designated as the national bird of Dominica,[4] and features on the national flag of Dominica. The species is critically endangered. In 2019, it was estimated there were only about 50 mature individuals left in the wild.</p>

                <h2>Description
                </h2>
                <p>The imperial amazon measures an average of 48 cm (19 in) in length.[5] With males weighing an average of 900 g (32 oz) and females 650 g (23 oz), the species is large for its genus.[5]

                    Being of the family Psittacidae, the sisserou has zygodactyl feet and a thick, hooked bill with a muscular tongue.[6] This bill is fashioned in such a way that, using its hinged mandibles and tongue, the sisserou can easily move food around in its mouth.[6]
                    
                    Males and females have identical plumage: the chest is a dark shade of purple, and the upper parts and feathers are a dark shade of green, with black-edged feather tips.[5] The eye-ring is dark brown, with the eye being a mix of orange and red.[5] Juvenile appearance does not differ much, with a higher occurrence of green plumage and strictly brown eyes.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The breeding male mallard is unmistakable, with a glossy bottle-green head and a white collar that demarcates the head from the purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly.[28] The rear of the male is black, with white-bordered dark tail feathers.[25]: 506  The bill of the male is a yellowish-orange tipped with black, with that of the female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown.[29] The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to very dark brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe.</p>

                <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
                <p>
                    The spoon-billed sandpiper's breeding habitat is sea coasts and adjacent hinterland on the Chukchi Peninsula and southwards along the isthmus of the Kamchatka Peninsula. It migrates down the Pacific coast through Japan, Korea and China, to its main wintering grounds in south and southeast Asia, where it has been recorded from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore.[1]

Through phylogenetic analyses for the complete mitogenome sequence, South Korean and Chinese C. pygmaea groups were indicated to be closely related to Arenaria interpres because of the similarity in the series of protein-coding genes.[7]

In March 2024, a spoon-billed sandpiper was sighted in the Philippines at Balanga, Bataan mudflat.

                <h2>Behavior</h2>
                <p>The call of the sisserou resides in the higher frequencies, a loud and even "squeaky" mix between shriek, squawk, and trill.[5] They are shy, difficult to approach, and usually travel in groups of three or fewer.[5][7] They sometimes flock together with red-necked amazons.[7] They are good climbers and strong flyers with powerful wings.[8] They prefer to perch on the tops of trees.[8] They are difficult to detect, as they are well camouflaged by their plumage.</p>

                <h2>Breeding</h2>
                <p>Between February and April, nesting occurs and the female will lay a clutch of two white eggs in a deep cavity inside a rainforest tree,[5] returning to the same tree year after year. For 26–28 days, the female will incubate the eggs.[5] During fledging, which occurs between June and early September, both parents will take care of and feed the chicks until they are fully feathered and ready to leave the nest.[5] The chicks use typical "begging calls" when hungry, to which either parent will respond with food.[9] Usually only one chick survives to fledging and, typically, sisserou pairs fledge a single chick every other year; however, there have been documented exceptions.[9]

                    These parrots mate for life and are extremely faithful to each other.[8] They might seek another mate only after a mate dies. However, the bird may grieve to death rather than find a new mate.</p>
