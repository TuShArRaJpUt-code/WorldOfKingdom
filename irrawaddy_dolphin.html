                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> The Irrawaddy dolphin  is a euryhaline species of oceanic dolphin found in scattered subpopulations near sea coasts and in estuaries and rivers in parts of the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia.</li></p><p><li class="list"> It closely resembles the Australian snubfin dolphin , which was not described as a separate species until 2005.</li></p><p><li class="list"> It has a slate blue to a slate gray color. Although found in much of the riverine and marine zones of South and Southeast Asia, the only concentrated lagoon populations are found in Chilika Lake in Odisha, India and Songkhla Lake in southern Thailand.</li></p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> The Irrawaddy dolphin's colour is grey to dark slate blue, paler underneath, without a distinctive pattern. The dorsal fin is small and rounded behind the middle of the back.</li></p><p><li class="list"> The forehead is high and rounded; the beak is lacking. The front of its snout is blunt. The flippers are broad and rounded. The finless porpoise  is similar and has no back fin; the humpback dolphin is larger, and has a longer beak and a larger dorsal fin.</li></p><p><li class="list"> It ranges in weight from 90 to 200 kg  with a length of 2.3 m  at full maturity.</li></p>

            <p><li class="list"> It has a large melon and a blunt, rounded head, and the beak is indistinct. Its dorsal fin, located about two-thirds posterior along the back, is short, blunt, and triangular.</li></p>

                <h2>Behaviour</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> Communication is carried out with clicks, creaks, and buzzes at a dominant frequency of about 60  kilohertz, which is thought to be used for echolocation.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Bony fish and fish eggs, cephalopods, and crustaceans are taken as food. Observations of captive animals indicate food may be taken into the mouth by suction.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Irrawaddy dolphins are capable of squirting streams of water that can reach up to 1.5 metres ; this distinct behaviour has been known for herding fish into a general area for hunting.</li></p>

                <h2>Reproduction</h2>
                <p>These dolphins are thought to reach sexual maturity at seven to nine years. In the Northern Hemisphere, mating is reported from December to June. Its gestation period is 14 months; cows give birth to a single calf every two to three years. Length is about 1 m  at birth. Birth weight is about 10 kg . Weaning is after two years. Lifespan is about 30 years.</p>

                <p><li class="list"> Although sometimes called the Irrawaddy river dolphin, it is not a true river dolphin, but an oceanic dolphin that lives in brackish water near coasts, river mouths, and estuaries.</li></p><p><li class="list"> It has established subpopulations in freshwater rivers, including the Ganges and the Mekong, as well as the Irrawaddy River from which it takes its name.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Its range extends from the Bay of Bengal to New Guinea and the Philippines, although it does not appear to venture off shore. It is often seen in estuaries and bays in Borneo Island, with sightings from Sandakan in Sabah, Malaysia, to most parts of Brunei and Sarawak, Malaysia.</li></p>

                <h2>Interaction with humans</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> Irrawaddy dolphins have a mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with traditional fishers. Fishers in India recall when they would call out to the dolphins, by tapping a wooden key also known as a lahai kway, against the sides of their boats, asking the Irrawaddys to drive fish into their nets.</li></p><p><li class="list"> In Burma, in the upper reaches of the Ayeyarwady River, Irrawaddy dolphins drive fish towards fishers using cast nets in response to acoustic signals from them.</li></p><p><li class="list"> The fishermen attempt to gain the attention of the dolphins through various efforts such as using a cone-shaped wooden stick to drum the side of their canoes, striking their paddles to the surface of the water, jingling their nets, or making calls that sound turkey-like.</li></p>

                <h2>International efforts</h2>
                <p>Protection from international trade is provided by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora . Enforcement, though, is the responsibility of individual countries. While some international trade for dolphinarium animals may have occurred, this is unlikely to have ever been a major threat to the species.</p>
