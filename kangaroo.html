                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Kangaroos are marsupials from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning "large foot"). In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, as well as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo.[1] Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea. The Australian government estimates that 42.8 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2 million in 2013.[2]

                    As with the terms "wallaroo" and "wallaby", "kangaroo" refers to a paraphyletic grouping of species. All three terms refer to members of the same taxonomic family, Macropodidae, and are distinguished according to size. .</p>

                <h2>Terminology</h2>
                <p>The word kangaroo derives from the Guugu Yimithirr word gangurru, referring to eastern grey kangaroos.[14][15] The name was first recorded as "kanguru" on 12 July 1770 in an entry in the diary of Sir Joseph Banks; this occurred at the site of modern Cooktown, on the banks of the Endeavour River, where HMS Endeavour under the command of Lieutenant James Cook was beached for almost seven weeks to repair damage sustained on the Great Barrier Reef.[16] Cook first referred to kangaroos in his diary entry of 4 August. Guugu Yimithirr is the language of the people of the area.

                    A common myth about the kangaroo's English name is that it was a Guugu Yimithirr phrase for "I don't know" or "I don't understand".[17] According to this legend, Cook and Banks were exploring the area when they happened upon the animal. They asked a nearby local what the creatures were called.</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>There are three extant species that are commonly referred to as kangaroos:
                    <ul>
                     <li>The red kangaroo (Osphranter rufus)[24] is the largest surviving marsupial anywhere in the world. It occupies the arid and semi-arid centre of the country. The highest population densities of the red kangaroo occur in the rangelands of western New South Wales. Red kangaroos are commonly mistaken as the most abundant species of kangaroo, but eastern greys actually have a larger population.[25] A large male can be 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb).</li>
                     <li>The eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus)[24] is less well-known than the red (outside Australia), but the most often seen, as its range covers the fertile eastern part of the country.  </li>
                   
                    </ul>
                </p>
                    
            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Comparison with wallabies</h2>
                <p>Kangaroos and wallabies belong to the same taxonomic family (Macropodidae) and often the same genera, but kangaroos are specifically categorised into the four largest species of the family. The term wallaby is an informal designation generally used for any macropod that is smaller than a kangaroo or a wallaroo that has not been designated otherwise.</p>

                <h2>Biology and behaviour</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Locomotion</h3>
                            <p>Kangaroos are the only large mammals to use hopping on two legs as their primary means of locomotion.[36] The comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about 20–25 km/h (12–16 mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (43 mph) can be attained over short distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for nearly 2 km (1.2 mi).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Diet</h3>
                            <p>Kangaroos have single-chambered stomachs quite unlike those of cattle and sheep, which have four compartments.[39][40] They sometimes regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then swallow it again for final digestion. </p>
                            
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Social and sexual behavior</h2>
                <p>Groups of kangaroos are called mobs, courts or troupes, which usually have 10 or more kangaroos in them. Living in mobs can provide protection for some of the weaker members of the group.[23] The size and stability of mobs vary between geographic regions,[28][46][47] with eastern Australia having larger and more stable aggregations than in arid areas farther west.[28] Larger aggregations display high amounts of interactions and complex social structures, comparable to that of ungulates.</p>
