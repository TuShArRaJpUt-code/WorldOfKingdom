                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> The lion  is a large mammal of the Felidae family. Some large males weigh over 250 kg . Today, wild lions live in sub-Saharan Africa and western India.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Lions are adapted for life in grasslands and mixed areas with trees and grass. The relatively small females are fast runners over short distances, and coordinate their hunting of herd animals.</li></p>

            <p><li class="list">     Lions have disappeared from North Africa and southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans.</li></p> 
                  <p><li class="list">  Lions live for 10 to 14 years in the wild. </li></p>

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>The word "lion" comes from the Latin word "leo" which means lion. The Latin word itself is derived from the Greek word "leon". Both words originally came from even older languages such as Sanskrit and Ancient Egyptian. Basically, the word "lion" has been passed down through different civilizations over time</p>

                <h2>Adapation</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> They have an archetypal roar which is used to communicate with other group members and warn different intruders of territorial boundaries.</li></p>

                 <p><li class="list">   They have long, retractable claws which help the lion to grab and hold prey. They also have a rough tongue that helps them peel the skin of prey animals away from flesh and flesh away from bone.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Across their belly, they have loose skin which allows the species to be kicked by prey with little chance of an injury.</li></p>

                <h2>Behaviour</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> Lions live in groups that are called prides. About 10 to 40 lions may live in a pride. Each pride has a home area that is called a territory.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Lions do not allow other carnivores  to hunt in their territory. A territory can be as large as 260 square kilometres .</li></p>

                 <p><li class="list">  The lions' roar is unique in each individual. It is used for territorial marking and warning off other lions in separate prides .</li></p><p><li class="list"> This however, is usually carried out by competing males. Other male lions will challenge the alpha of the pride to a fight in order to take their spot of dominance if they win. Lions actually have prides in order to strengthen their species throughout the generations .</li></p>
