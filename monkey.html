                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope.

                    In 1812, Étienne Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae group of monkeys together and established the name Catarrhini, "Old World monkeys" ("singes de l'Ancien Monde" in French).[3][4][5] The extant sister of the Catarrhini in the monkey ("singes") group is the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys).</p>

                <h2>Historical and modern terminology</h2>
                <p>According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word "monkey" may originate in a German version of the Reynard the Fox fable, published c. 1580. In this version of the fable, a character named Moneke is the son of Martin the Ape.[29] In English, no clear distinction was originally made between "ape" and "monkey"; thus the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica entry for "ape" notes that it is either a synonym for "monkey" or is used to mean a tailless humanlike primate.[30] Colloquially, the terms "monkey" and "ape" are widely used interchangeably.[31][32] Also, a few monkey species have the word "ape" in their common name, such as the Barbary ape.

                    Later in the first half of the 20th century, the idea developed that there were trends in primate evolution and that the living members of the order could be arranged in a series, leading through "monkeys" and "apes" to humans.[33] Monkeys thus constituted a "grade" on the path to humans and were distinguished from "apes".</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    As apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world monkeys, characteristics that describe monkeys are generally shared by apes as well. Williams et al. outlined evolutionary features, including in stem groupings, contrasted against the other primates such as the tarsiers and the lemuriformes.[44]

                    Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 mm (4+5⁄8 in) with a 172 mm (6+3⁄4 in) tail and just over 100 g (3+1⁄2 oz) in weight,[45] to the male mandrill, almost 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long and weighing up to 36 kg (79 lb).[46] Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders).

                <h2>Classification</h2>
                <p>The following list shows where the various monkey families (bolded) are placed in the classification of living (extant) primates.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Order Primates</li>
                        <li>Suborder Strepsirrhini: lemurs, lorises, and galagos</li>
                        <li>Suborder Haplorhini: tarsiers, monkeys, and apes
                        </li>
                        <li>Infraorder Tarsiiformes
                        </li>

                <h2>Cladogram with extinct families</h2>
                <p>Below is a cladogram with some extinct monkey families.[48][49][50] Generally, extinct non-hominoid simians, including early catarrhines are discussed as monkeys as well as simians or anthropoids,[41][9][42] which cladistically means that Hominoidea are monkeys as well, restoring monkeys as a single grouping. It is indicated approximately how many million years ago (Mya) the clades diverged into newer clades.[51][52][53][54] It is thought the New World monkeys started as a drifted "Old World monkey" group from the Old World (probably Africa) to the New World (South America).</p>

                <h2>Relationship with humans</h2>
                <p>The many species of monkey have varied relationships with humans. Some are kept as pets, others used as model organisms in laboratories or in space missions. They may be killed in monkey drives (when they threaten agriculture) or used as service animals for the disabled.

                    In some areas, some species of monkey are considered agricultural pests, and can cause extensive damage to commercial and subsistence crops.[55][56] This can have important implications for the conservation of endangered species, which may be subject to persecution. In some instances farmers' perceptions of the damage may exceed the actual damage.[57] Monkeys that have become habituated to human presence in tourist locations may also be considered pests, attacking tourists.[</p>
