                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> A seahorse  is any of 46 species of small marine bony fish in the genus Hippocampus. "Hippocampus" comes from the Ancient Greek hippókampos , itself from híppos  meaning "horse" and kámpos meaning "sea monster"or "sea animal".</li></p><p><li class="list"> Having a head and neck suggestive of a horse, seahorses also feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile tail. Along with the pipefishes and seadragons  they form the family Syngnathidae.</li></p>

                <h2>Habitat</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> Seahorses are mainly found in shallow tropical and temperate salt water throughout the world, from about 45°S to 45°N.</li></p><p><li class="list"> They live in sheltered areas such as seagrass beds, estuaries, coral reefs, and mangroves. Four species are found in Pacific waters from North America to South America. In the Atlantic, Hippocampus erectus ranges from Nova Scotia to Uruguay.</li></p><p><li class="list"> H. zosterae, known as the dwarf seahorse, is found in the Bahamas.

                    Colonies have been found in European waters such as the Thames Estuary.</li></p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> Seahorses range in size from 1.5 to 35 cm. They are named for their equine appearance, with bent necks and long snouted heads and a distinctive trunk and tail.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Although they are bony fish, they do not have scales, but rather thin skin stretched over a series of bony plates, which are arranged in rings throughout their bodies.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Each species has a distinct number of rings. The armor of bony plates also protects them against predators, and because of this outer skeleton, they no longer have ribs.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Seahorses swim upright, propelling themselves using the dorsal fin, another characteristic not shared by their close pipefish relatives, which swim horizontally. Razorfish are the only other fish that swim vertically.</li></p>

                <h2>Evolution and fossil record</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> Anatomical evidence, supported by molecular, physical, and genetic evidence, demonstrates that seahorses are highly modified pipefish.</li></p><p><li class="list"> The fossil record of seahorses, however, is very sparse. The best known and best studied fossils are specimens of Hippocampus guttulatus , from the Marecchia River formation of Rimini Province, Italy, dating back to the Lower Pliocene, about 3 million years ago.</li></p><p><li class="list"> The earliest known seahorse fossils are of two pipefish-like species, H. sarmaticus and H. slovenicus, from the coprolitic horizon of Tunjice Hills, a middle Miocene lagerstätte in Slovenia dating back about 13 million years.</li></p>

                <h2>Reproduction</h2>
                <p>The male seahorse is equipped with a brood pouch on the ventral, or front-facing, side of the tail. When mating, the female seahorse deposits up to 1,500 eggs in the male's pouch. The male carries the eggs for 9 to 45 days until the seahorses emerge fully developed, but very small. The young are then released into the water, and the male often mates again within hours or days during the breeding season.</p>

                <h2>Fertilization</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> During fertilization in Hippocampus kuda the brood pouch was found to be open for only six seconds while egg deposition occurred. During this time seawater entered the pouch where the spermatozoa and eggs meet in a seawater milieu.</li></p><p><li class="list"> This hyperosmotic environment facilitates sperm activation and motility. The fertilization is therefore regarded as being physiologically 'external' within a physically 'internal' environment after the closure of the pouch.</li></p><p><li class="list"> It is believed that this protected form of fertilization reduces sperm competition among males.</li></p>

                <h2>Feeding habits</h2>
                <p><li class="list"> Seahorses use their long snouts to eat their food with ease. However, they are slow to consume their food and have extremely simple digestive systems that lack a stomach, so they must eat constantly to stay alive.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Seahorses are not very good swimmers, and for this reason they need to anchor themselves to seaweed, coral or anything else that will keep the seahorse in place.</li></p><p><li class="list"> They do this by using their prehensile tails to grasp their object of choice.Seahorses feed on small crustaceans floating in the water or crawling on the bottom. With excellent camouflage seahorses ambush prey that floats within striking range, sitting and waiting until an optimal moment.</li></p><p><li class="list"> Mysid shrimp and other small crustaceans are favorites, but some seahorses have been observed eating other kinds of invertebrates and even larval fish.</li></p>
