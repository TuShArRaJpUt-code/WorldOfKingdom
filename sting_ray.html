            <div class="text">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Stingrays are a group of sea rays, a type of cartilaginous fish. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays) and Myliobatidae (eagle rays).[2][3] There are about 220 known stingray species organized into 29 genera.

                    Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world. Some species, such as the thorntail stingray (Dasyatis thetidis), are found in warmer temperate oceans and others, such as the deepwater stingray (Plesiobatis daviesi), are found in the deep ocean. </p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <p>Stingrays diverged from their closest relatives, the panrays, during the Late Jurassic period, and diversified over the course of the Cretaceous into the different extant families today. The earliest stingrays appear to have been benthic, with the ancestors of the eagle rays becoming pelagic during the early Late Cretaceous.</p>

                <h2>Fossils</h2>
                <p>Permineralized stingray teeth have been found in sedimentary deposits around the world as far back as the Early Cretaceous. The oldest known stingray taxon is "Dasyatis" speetonensis from the Hauterivian of England, whose teeth most closely resemble that of the extant sixgill stingray (Hexatrygon). Although stingray teeth are rare on sea bottoms compared to the similar shark teeth, scuba divers searching for the latter do encounter the teeth of stingrays.</p>

                <h2>Anatomy</h2>
                <p>The mouth of the stingray is located on the ventral side of the vertebrate. Stingrays exhibit hyostylic jaw suspension, which means that the mandibular arch is only suspended by an articulation with the hyomandibula. This type of suspensions allows for the upper jaw to have high mobility and protrude outward.[12] The teeth are modified placoid scales that are regularly shed and replaced.[13] In general, the teeth have a root implanted within the connective tissue and a visible portion of the tooth, is large and flat, allowing them to crush the bodies of hard shelled prey.[14] Male stingrays display sexual dimorphism by developing cusps, or pointed ends, to some of their teeth. During mating season, some stingray species fully change their tooth morphology which then returns to baseline during non-mating seasons.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Behavior</h2>
                <p>During the breeding season, males of various stingray species such as the round stingray (Urobatis halleri), may rely on their ampullae of Lorenzini to sense certain electrical signals given off by mature females before potential copulation.[20] When a male is courting a female, he follows her closely, biting at her pectoral disc. He then places one of his two claspers into her valve.Reproductive ray behaviors are associated with their behavioral endocrinology, for example, in species such as the atlantic stingray (Hypanus sabinus), social groups are formed first, then the sexes display complex courtship behaviors that end in pair copulation which is similar to the species Urobatis halleri.[22] Furthermore, their mating period is one of the longest recorded in elasmobranch fish. Individuals are known to mate for seven months before the females ovulate in March. </p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Locomotion</h2>
                <p>The stingray uses its paired pectoral fins for moving around. This is in contrast to sharks and most other fish, which get most of their swimming power from a single caudal (tail) fin.[26][27] Stingray pectoral fin locomotion can be divided into two categories, undulatory and oscillatory.[28] Stingrays that use undulatory locomotion have shorter thicker fins for slower motile movements in benthic areas.[29] Longer thinner pectoral fins make for faster speeds in oscillation mobility in pelagic zones.[28] Visually distinguishable oscillation has less than one wave going, opposed to undulation having more than one wave at all times.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Feeding behavior and diet</h2>
                <p>Stingrays use a wide range of feeding strategies. Some have specialized jaws that allow them to crush hard mollusk shells,[30] whereas others use external mouth structures called cephalic lobes to guide plankton into their oral cavity.[31] Benthic stingrays (those that reside on the sea floor) are ambush hunters.[32] They wait until prey comes near, then use a strategy called "tenting".[33] With pectoral fins pressed against the substrate, the ray will raise its head, generating a suction force that pulls the prey underneath the body. This form of whole-body suction is analogous to the buccal suction feeding performed by ray-finned fish. Stingrays exhibit a wide range of colors and patterns on their dorsal surface to help them camouflage with the sandy bottom.</p>
