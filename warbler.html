                <h2>Intrpduction</h2>
                <p>Kirtland's warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii), also known in Michigan by the common name jack pine bird,[3][4] or the jack pine warbler, is a small songbird of the New World warbler family (Parulidae). Nearly extinct just years ago, populations have recovered due to the conservation efforts of Phil Huber and the U.S. Forest Service. The birds require large areas, greater than 160 acres (65 hectares), of dense young jack pine for breeding habitat. This habitat was historically created by wildfire, but today is created through the harvest of mature jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and planting of jack pine seedlings.</p>

                <h2>Taxonomy
                </h2>
                <p>This species was first recorded by Europeans relatively late for a bird from eastern North America.[5] The first specimen was shot at sea somewhere between the Abaco Islands of The Bahamas and Cuba in mid-October 1841 by the ornithologist Samuel Cabot III. However, the specimen was unrecognized as a new species in the private collection of Cabot's father, Boston merchant Samuel Cabot Jr., until it made its way to the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution in the 1860s.[6][7]

                    Ten years later the holotype, a juvenile male, was shot on Jared Potter Kirtland's farm near Cleveland, Ohio, in mid-May 1851.[8] It was used to formally describe the species as Sylvicola kirtlandii by Spencer Fullerton Baird in 1852.</p>

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>Baird decided to name the bird after Jared Potter Kirtland: "a gentleman to whom, more than any one living, we are indebted for a knowledge of the Natural History of the Mississippi Valley".[8] The generic epithet Setophaga is from the genitive case of Ancient Greek σής, transliterated as sḗs, meaning "moth", and phagos, meaning "eating".</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Male Kirtland's warblers have bluish-grey upper body parts, with dark streaks on the back, yellow bellies, and dark streaks on the flanks and sides. It has black lores (cheeks) and a distinctive, large and conspicuous broken white eye ring,[13][14] which it only shares with Setophaga coronata.[14] Females and juveniles are similar, but are browner on the wings and back and are not as boldly or brightly marked. It frequently bobs its tail up and down, which is uncommon in northern warblers. At 14–15 cm (5.5–5.9 in)[13] and 12.3–16 g (0.43–0.56 oz),[15] it is the largest of the numerous warblers formerly classified in the genus Dendroica and is now the largest of the 35 or so species in the currently-accepted Setophaga genus.[9] The Kirtland warbler has a wingspan of 22 cm (8.7 in). </p>

                <h2>Distribution</h2>
                <p>It was originally only known from Kirtland's home state of Ohio.[8] In the mid 20th century the breeding range of Kirtland's warbler was reduced to a very limited area in the north of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. In recent years, breeding pairs have been found in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Wisconsin, and southern Ontario due to the expanding population.[5] The birds winter in Cuba, The Bahamas and the nearby Turks and Caicos Islands, where they are found on all islands investigated.[17] A number also overwinter on Hispaniola, in the Dominican Republic.[7][14][19] Overwintering birds have been collected and sighted a number of times in Florida.[20] It has been recorded as a rare accidental on Bermuda and Jamaica,[11] and there is an uncorroborated report from coastal Mexico.[20][21] It has also been observed in the summer in Québec, although it is not known to breed there.</p>

                <h2>Ecology</h2>
                <p>The Kirtland's warbler's summer breeding habitat is in northern Michigan. Breeding habitat is where a bird lays its eggs and raises its babies. The Kirtland's warbler only builds its nests on the ground in young jack pine forests found in Michigan and sometimes Wisconsin.</p>
