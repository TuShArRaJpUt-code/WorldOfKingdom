                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Zebras (US: /ˈziːbrəz/, UK: /ˈzɛbrəz, ˈziː-/)[2] (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi), the plains zebra (E. quagga), and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these patterns, with most evidence supporting them as a deterrent for biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands, and mountainous areas.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>The English name "zebra" derives from Italian, Spanish or Portuguese.[3][4] Its origins may lie in the Latin equiferus, meaning "wild horse". Equiferus appears to have entered into Portuguese as ezebro or zebro, which was originally used for a legendary equine in the wilds of the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages. In 1591, Italian explorer Filippo Pigafetta recorded "zebra" being used to refer to the African animals by Portuguese visitors to the continent.[5] In ancient times, the zebra was called hippotigris ("horse tiger") by the Greeks and Romans.[5][6]

                    The word zebra was traditionally pronounced with a long initial vowel, but over the course of the 20th century the pronunciation with the short initial vowel became the norm in British English.[7] The pronunciation with a long initial vowel remains standard in American English.</p>

                <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
                <p>
                    Zebras are classified in the genus Equus (known as equines) along with horses and asses. These three groups are the only living members of the family Equidae.[9] The plains zebra and mountain zebra were traditionally placed in the subgenus Hippotigris (C. H. Smith, 1841) in contrast to the Grévy's zebra which was considered the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus (Heller, 1912).[10][11][12] Groves and Bell (2004) placed all three species in the subgenus Hippotigris.[13] A 2013 phylogenetic study found that the plains zebra is more closely related to Grévy's zebras than mountain zebras.[14] The extinct quagga was originally classified as a distinct species.[15] Later genetic studies have placed it as the same species as the plains zebra, either a subspecies or just the southernmost population.[16][17] Molecular evidence supports zebras as a monophyletic lineage.

                <h2>Fossil record</h2>
                <p>In addition to the three living species, some fossil zebras and relatives have also been identified. Equus koobiforensis is an early equine basal to zebras found in the Shungura Formation, Ethiopia and the Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, and dated to around 2.3 mya.[36] E. oldowayensis is identified from remains in Olduvai Gorge dating to 1.8 mya.[37] Fossil skulls of E. mauritanicus from Algeria which date to around 1 mya appears to show affinities with the plains zebra.[38][39] E. capensis, known as the Cape zebra, appeared around 2 mya and lived throughout southern and eastern Africa.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Hybridisation</h2>
                <p>Fertile hybrids have been reported in the wild between plains and Grévy's zebra.[40] Hybridisation has also been recorded between the plains and mountain zebra, though it is possible that these are infertile due to the difference in chromosome numbers between the two species.[41] Captive zebras have been bred with horses and donkeys; these are known as zebroids. A zorse is a cross between a zebra and a horse; a zonkey, between a zebra and a donkey; and a zoni, between a zebra and a pony. Zebroids are often born sterile with dwarfism. </p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Characteristics</h2>
                <p>As with all wild equines, zebras have barrel-chested bodies with tufted tails, elongated faces and long necks with long, erect manes. Their thin legs are each supported by a spade-shaped toe covered in a hard hoof. Their dentition is adapted for grazing; they have large incisors that clip grass blades and rough molars and premolars well suited for grinding. Males have spade-shaped canines, which can be used as weapons in fighting. The eyes of zebras are at the sides and far up the head, which allows them to look over the tall grass while feeding. Their moderately long, erect ears are movable and can locate the source of a sound.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Stripes</h2>
                <p>Zebras are easily recognised by their bold black-and-white striping patterns. The coat appears to be white with black stripes, as indicated by the belly and legs when unstriped, but the skin is black.[44][45][46] Young or foals are born with brown and white coats, and the brown darkens with age.[28][25] A dorsal line acts as the backbone for vertical stripes along the sides, from the head to the rump. On the snout they curve toward the nostrils, while the stripes above the front legs split into two branches. On the rump, they develop into species-specific patterns. The stripes on the legs, ears and tail are separate and horizontal.</p>
